# ** ** TIR-Learner: a new ensemble method for TIR Transposable Element annotation
# Introduction
TIR-Learner is a ensemble pipeline for Terminal Inverted Repeat (TIR) transposable elements annotation.  TIR-Learner combines homology-based detection using a newly curated TIR element library with a structure-based method to identify TIR elements de novo.  The structure-based component includes Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to classify the output sequences into five major TIR superfamilies.
